# GameRanger Account Switcher
The GameRanger Account Switcher is a tool for the multiplayer gaming client known as GameRanger. GameRanger is great except for some odd reason it lacks one basic feature: the option to log out of a account and log into a different one. This makes it where familys that share computers have to share their GameRanger account as well. With this tool, instead of opening GameRanger right away, you will open this tool and select your account from a list, it will do itâ€™s magic and launch GameRanger logged into the account of your choosing.
